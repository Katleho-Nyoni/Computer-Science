# DESCRIPTION
This repository reflects some of my learning journey into learning aspects of Computer Science(CS) such as Object Oriented Programming(OOP), Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA).
The code in the subfolders shows my interactive learning from courses I took from LinkedIn Learning and YouTube.
It includes using and learning the languages :
- C
- C++
- Python

The learning was mostly practical, focusing on how to implement these in the respective languages. but I have currently paused and focusing on learning the theoretical aspects of CS.
